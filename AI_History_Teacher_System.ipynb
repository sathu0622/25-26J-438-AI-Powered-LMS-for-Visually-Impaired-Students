The kings from Dambadeni to Kotte periods acted to build palaces for the sacred Tooth relic and construct many temples and monasteries. There are proofs that the people of this time had a great devotion and belief in god. They believed in the gods such as Upulwan, Vibheeshana, Skandakumar and Saman and constructed Devalas for the gods. There is a reference to the gods Upulwan and Vibhishana in Sandesha Kavyas. There is information that there was a Shiva Devala adjacent to Sri Jayawardhanpura in the f ifteenth century. It is believed that it must have been constructed for Siva devotees. The Munneshvaram temple in Chilaw was a sacred religious place for the Hindus during this time. There were sacred Islamic religious places in sea port areas where the Muslim devotees resided and engaged in their international trade affairs.\",\n          \"Many details of the ancient architecture are found when the ruins in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa kingdoms are examined. That displays to us how different artisans in the ancient time had made great architectural creations. You will study some of the best architectural creations here. Architecture \\u0096 Many architectural creations such as Buddhist constructions, Stupas, Bodhigharas, Pilimageval, shrines, monasteries, alms halls, meditating cells, palaces, fortresses, and hospitals found from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa eras could be seen. T hose evidences show us that there were buildings from the ancient time in this country. Very advanced scientific knowledge and a training on technology would need to put that scientific knowledge into practice in constructing the buildings found in Anuradhapura such as Jethvanaramaya, Abhayagiriya, Ruwanweli Seya, and several storeyed Lovamahapaya. For example Ruwanweli Seya and the other Stupas, built in Anuradhapura in the North Central dry zone in Sri Lanka which gets heavy monsoon rains, may be vulnerable to lightning strikes at any time. But, there are neither historical nor archaeological evidences to prove that they were struck by lightning. The reason for this is that the ancient engineers had acted to provide the scientific application to those buildings to protect them from such accidents. It is taught in physics that lightning occurs when static electricity passes between clouds containing two contradictory electric charges. Such extremely powerful current comes to the earth through a tall object with electric conduction. When the electricity passes in that manner, the object is destroyed by burning. You will learn more details of this process in your science lesson. At present even some houses have lightning conductor to get protection from lightning. When Ruwanweli Seya was built, the engineers, who built it, did not forget to fix a lightning conductor. In historical sources that tool is introduced in the name of \\u0091Vajra chumbata,. \\u0091Vajra\\u0092 is the lightning which is an electric current generated naturally. The word \\u0091Chumbata\\u0092 has derived from the word \\u0091chumbaka\\u0092 (magnetic). Its meaning is \\u0091Kandama\\u0092. In Sinhalese language \\u0091Kandama\\u0092 means \\u0091attract\\u0092 or \\u0091cling\\u0092. Therefore, using the word \\u0091Vajra chumbata\\u0092 to name the structure made at the top of Ruwanweli Seya to attract lightning is appropriate. The electricity created by lightning is known as \\u0091static electricity\\u0092. It is taught in physics. The Foundation of Ruwanweli Seya Ruwanweli Seya was constructed by king Dutugemunu. It was the biggest Stupa constructed by that time. An adequately long description on an ancient construction has only been written about Ruwanweli Seya. Specially, a vivid and a descriptive explanation has been given in the historical sources about how the foundation of this great Stupa was made. According to it, first the earth of the place, where the Stupa was due to be built, had been dug in seven Riyanas (cubits) deep. Secondly, using strong men lime stones were brought, put them into the pit, broken them into pieces, poured water and trampled them well using tuskers wearing shoes made of animal skin. Thirdly, a type of clay named Wendaru was laid among those stones to reinforce them. Fourthly, another layer of stones and a layer of gravel were laid on it respectively. A layer of crystal was laid on the gravel layer. A type of clay named ' Navaneetha\\u0092 was smeared on that stone layer. Next, an iron net smeared with wood apple gum dissolved with a chemical fluid was laid upon it. Finally, the stones named \\u0091Ransiriyal\\u0092 soaked with sesame oil were laid upon it. When we pay our attention to this description, we can understand that the foundation of Ruwanweli Seya has been made according to a similar method of the modern concrete technology. Such kind of strong base has been laid because it is a must that the heaviness of the mammoth stupa made of bricks is sustained for a long time without any damage. This example clearly reflects the way that our engineers thought and acted in making a huge construction and the scientific thought relevant to it two thousand and two hundred years ago. Urban Park Designing T here was an advanced knowledge of constructing buildings and designing parks in our ancient society. The best example that can be given for this is the city plan of Sigiriya and its park complex. Sigiriya is a great city centre which was built in the 5th century A.D. It has been built centreing a huge rock which stands alone. The Sigiriya rock is 200 metres in height from its surrounding valley. The extent of the top of the rock, on which ruins of a palace could be seen, is approximately three hectares. The eastern and western royal accesses located focusing on the rock are of 40 hectares and 90 hectares respectively. The brick walls which have been constructed around the city complex for its security is approximately 10 kilometres. Apart from this, the entire length of the moats made around the Sigiriya rock is 8 kilometres. All of these things have been built according to a properly planned mathematical structure. Hygiene and Medicinal Method Sri Lanka has a considerable history of medicine. Mahawamsa mentions the maternity houses (Sivikasala) which had been built in Anuradhapura during the ruling period of king Pandukabhaya. The Wamsakatha mention that king Dutugemunu had built eighteen hospitals. We earlier mentioned the details mentioned in the inscriptions about doctors who worked in those hospitals in this book. Some ancient rulers of our country had mastered the medicine. Or else they extended their fullest support to widen the practice of medicine. In 1982 the archaeologists were able to find some significant evidences regarding this. They were found when the ancient land, called Alahana Pirivena situated in polled Polonnaruwa, with ruins, was excavated. In that place ruins of an ancient hospital emerged. T here was a hospital building of 147.5 feet in width and 109.2 feet in length. The instruments which were used for complex surgeries too were there among the things discovered from the place. Those relics show us that our ancient indigenous medicine was much advanced. Apart from this, information has been discovered on medicinal texts, herbal boats, allocating lands for indigenous doctors, growing herbal gardens. We can understand that ancient people had acquired a good understanding about waste management from the remaining ruins of lavatories. The lavatory systems used in the palaces were prepared to send the waste to a very deep pit. It seems that they had acted to emit the waste in a manner in which no any harm was done to the environment. A gutter for unclean water too has been discovered from the ruins in Polonnaruwa. Special tubes were fixed in bathing ponds to pump the polluted water out. Mahawamsa mentions that there were seven lavatories built in comparison to the buildings at the Alahana monastery (Pirivena). Accordingly, it is clear that in designing ancient buildings, the hygiene of their users had been paid much attention to. The Ancient Iron Leaching Technology From very ancient time our ancestors knew the iron leaching technology well. The archaeologists were able to discover a piece of iron- slag from a tomb dated in 2400 B.C. in Beragala in the Uva province. It is a piece of evidence which reflects that the iron was melted in those days. T here are two instances which assist us to understand the nature of iron leaching technology in Sri Lanka. The first one among them is the iron melting furnaces found in the Samanala Wewa area in Balangoda in the Sabaragamuwa province. The second one is the ancient iron furnaces discovered in the Alakolawewa, Dehigaha Elakanda area close to Sigiriya which belongs to the Central province. The natural stones abundant with iron have to be heated much to leach iron from them. Iron melts at 1538 degree Celsius. There should be an efficient technology to get an excessive-temperature. Iron leaching in Samanala Wewa has been done in third century B.C. The natural wind power has been used to inflame the furnaces used for melting. T he furnaces built in a mountain face would flame for nearly about 12 hours without extinguishing with the help of the wind blowing between the hills. Even today during the monsoon time the wind, which blows across that area in the evening, continues until the dawn of next day. The natural stones with iron that were put into the furnaces after breaking them into pieces would be inflamed by placing cinders on them with the help of the natural wind power in the evening which would blow until the following dawn. By the following morning iron would be leached from the stones. The stones, which were used in Samanala Wewa to leach iron, are the types introduced in the terms \\u0091Limonite\\u0092 and \\u0091Hematite\\u0092 in chemistry. To inflame those furnaces, they had used the cinders taken by burning the trees called \\u0091Maran\\u0092. Even now these trees can be seen in this province. The term \\u0091Yakada Maran\\u0092 too is used to name these trees. T he wind power to inflame the furnaces in Dehigahaelakanda area has been provided with the help of bellows. From 180 B.C. to 200 A.D. iron leaching had been done there. Minor Industries \\u0096 Apart from this, making various jewellery, clay industry, gem industry and forging industry were under minor industries. T he golden jewellery found in the excavations in Jethawanaya can be taken as the best example for the technology of making various jewellery. It is a part of a pendant as small as a paddy seed. There had been 21 flowery carvings on it. It may be a challenge to the modern goldsmith. And also, the coloured roof tiles discovered in Abhayagiriya excavations reflect the advancement of the ancient clay industry in this country. When we examined the instruments such as various types of arms and defense items found so far, it seems that there was a vast advancement in the forging industry.\",\n          \"During the time when King Mihindu V was the last ruler of the Anuradhapura kingdom it collapsed due to Chola invasions and afterwards King Vijayabahu I liberated the country from the Cholas and united the country by making Polonnaruwa his capital. The political turmoil which prevailed after the demise of King Vijayabahu I due to the internal problems was ended and the country was reunited by King Parakramabahu I. He developed the capital Polonnaruwa further and made this country prosperous again by reconstructing the irrigation system. But, it seems that the Polonnaruwa kingdom fell into a track of gradual decline due to the political disorders emerged after the demise of King Parakramabahu I. After King Parakramabahu I, only King Nissankamalla carried out a strong ruling for nine years. There were several reasons for the gradual decline and the downfall of the Polonnaruwa kingdom. 1. Weak rulers came to power During a period of 29 years from the year 1186 in which King Parakramabahu I\\u0092s demise took place and to the year 1215 in which the downfall of Polonnaruwa kingdom occurred, 12 rulers came to power from time to time. Among them, except for the 9 years\\u0092 ruling period of King Nissankamalla, the ruling periods of all the others\\u0092 were limited to very brief time periods. T his clearly shows that those rulers could not build a political stability. It caused the decline of the Polonnaruwa kingdom. 2. Power struggle between the Pandyan and Kalinga clans After the death of King Vijayabahu I, the fights between the Pandyan and Kalinga clans who were in this country aggravated. As a result, the people who supported the Pandyan clan tried to bring Pandyan leaders to power. In the same way those who supported the Kalinga clan attempted to bring their leaders to power. As a result of this, the Kalingas , after the death of king Nissankamalla, who belonged to their clan, brought several Kalinga members such as, king Nissankamalla\\u0092s nephew (his sister\\u0092s son) Chodanga, his brother Sahasamalla, his wife Kalyanawathi to power. T he Pandyans brought queen Leelawathi, the wife of king Parakramabahu I, to power thrice. T hus, the struggle between the Pandyans and the Kalingas was a reason for the decline of the Polonnaruwa kingdom. 3. Economic Deterioration Since weak rulers came to power after the death of King Nissankamalla and as they could not build a political stability, it seems that the tanks and anicuts were not maintained properly. As there were political disorder at this time, provincial ruling too may have been paralyzed. This led to a decline in agriculture and trade. This led to a complete economic paralysis. 4. Invasion of Kalinga Magha The immediate reason that affected the decline of the Polonnaruwa kingdom was the invasion of Kalinga Magha. When Magha invaded this country with a huge army in 1215, Sri Lankans could not face them due to the disordered political situation that prevailed in the country. As a result of that, the city of Polonnaruwa and a number of areas in Rajarata went under Magha\\u0092s army. When we consider the destruction, and the outcomes of the invasion of Magha, it made a great influence not only on the capital of Polonnaruwa, but also on the Rajarata civilization, which had a history of not less than one thousand and five hundred years. This is a part from Mahawamsa, which describes the destruction caused by Magha: \\u0093People were tied, tortured and made them beggars by looting their wealth; statues were broken down, temples were robbed; devotees were attacked; children were beaten (..by the invaders).\\u0094 Thus, due to the destructive activities of the enemies, there was no security for the lives and properties of the Rajarata people. Its result was that the oppressed monks and the people migrated to Ruhuna, Malaya Rata (upcountry) or Maya rata for protection. T herefore, many areas in Rajarata were devoid of people. Some parts freed from the central ruling became rural areas. The religious places such as, Ruwanweli Seya, Abhayagiriya, and Jethawanaramaya, which were worshipped daily, were gradually went into wilderness. Many populated cities in Anuradhapura became ruins. The reasons for the decline of the ancient cities: \\u00b7 Invasions of the enemies \\u00b7 Downfall of the central ruling \\u00b7 Lack of security \\u00b7 Paralysis of the trade and transport affairs Migration of people to other areas\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"In the second urbanization (Dambadeniya\\u0096Kotte), Buddhism remained dominant; kings built Tooth Relic palaces, temples, monasteries.
