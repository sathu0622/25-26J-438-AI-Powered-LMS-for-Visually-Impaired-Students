1.Industrial Revolution,Grade 11:Beginning and Development of  the Industrial Revolution,"The industrial revolution began towards the latter part of the 18th century in Britain. It was limited to Britain for about another half century. Yet, by the 19th century, the influence of the industrial revolution spread to the other countries in Europe and the rest of the world. Trade was the major reason for the emergence of the industrial revolution in Europe. When the situation of Europe in the 18th century is analyzed, it can be seen that France, Portugal and Spain other than Britain engaged themselves in colonization and extensive trade. Therefore, it is important to inquire into the reasons why such a revolution began in Britain. ? Reasons for the Emergence of the Industrial Revolution in Britain Financial and commercial affairs started developing in Europe since the 16th century and by the 18th century, Britain had surpassed some of the other leading European countries such as Holland, France, Portugal and Spain. As a result a wealthy class who could invest money on industries was created in that country. At the same time, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high demand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand became a challenge. This led to a development in the industrial sector. Further, there was an expansion of the knowledge of science as a result of the Renaissance that took place in Europe in 14th and 15th centuries. This knowledge was used in producing - 1 new machinery. Minerals such as iron and steel that were necessary in producing machinery too were found in Britain. Not only that Britain easily found things like coal which played a major role in producing energy. T hough there was a heavy population in contemporary kingdoms such as France, the development of trade in those countries was limited in comparison to Britain. But, Britain had obstructed the commercial relationships of its colonies with other countries in the world by imposing several commercial laws. Thus, Britain was able to maintain a high demand for their productions in its own colonies because they had no other choice than importing those productions from Britain. Some of those products with high demand in Britain were suitable for the production using machines. One example is the high demand placed upon British cotton clothes by India. Though there was an increasing demand for British cotton clothes, they did not have the ability to increase the production within a short period with the existing production methods. Because of the high demand that existed for the British productions, there arose a need in increasing the production in a short period. It is as a solution to this challenge that there was a rapid development in the industrial f ield. T here were several changes in the agriculture field too in contemporary Britain. T here, the rich landowners combined small pieces of land that belonged to poor farmers and made large farms. This is termed as the “encroaching movement.” As a result of this, the farmers who lost their land migrated to cities in search of jobs. T he extra labour that was generated as a result was able to be used for the industrial development. Unlike in other countries, in Britain talented individuals had the opportunity to earn money irrespective of their social status. This free social environment in the attitudes supported the spread of novel ideas and it was conducive for the development of the industrial sector. Further, together with the development of the economy, the emergence of new banks and financial organizations that provided capital for the industries and businesses was seen. T he political stability that was prevailing in Britain too helped the industrial revolution. The parliament provided the freedom, tax relief and support to engage in business activities for the economic development. Compared with the other countries in Europe, Britain had the most conducive environment for the industrial revolution. A number of features such as being a small island, ability to build a web of markets throughout the country, ability to - 2 charge high prices for productions and London city being a centre that distributed raw materials, capital and products; helped Britain to surpass other countries in the industrial production field.","The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the late 18th century and spread globally in the 19th century, driven by trade. Britain led due to: Wealthy merchant class investing in industry; population growth increasing demand; Renaissance scientific knowledge applied to machines; abundant coal/iron resources; colonial trade monopoly (high demand for British goods like cotton textiles in India); enclosure movement displacing farmers ? urban factory labor; social mobility encouraging innovation; stable politics/banks providing capital; island geography aiding internal markets/London hub.","In late 18th-century Britain, sparks flew—trade winds swelled sails, colonies craved cotton, population boomed. Wealthy merchants poured gold into invention; Renaissance minds forged machines from iron veins and coal hearts. Enclosures swept small farmers to smoky cities, feeding factory fires. Banks bloomed, parliament cheered freedom, London pulsed as empire’s heart. No rival matched: France war-torn, Spain distant—Britain’s island forged the world’s workshop. From hand loom to steam engine, a revolution roared, remaking life forever.",wonder,"steam_engine_whistle, factory_hammer, clinking_coins, bustling_market, gentle_wind, chime"
1.Industrial Revolution,Grade 11: Rise in Key Industries,"The industrial revolution in Britain was based on three industries as given below. ? Textile industry ? Iron and steel industry ? Coal industry T he development that occurred in these fields resulted in the gradual progress in other fields such as transport, communication and agriculture. ?Textile Industry Textile producers in Britain faced a challenge of increasing their textile products to meet the high demand that came from their own colonies. Weaving clothes became a little faster with the invention of the flying shuttle by John K. in 1733. But the slowness in preparing threads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem. According to the situation that was there at that time, threads produced by six thread makers per day were enough only for one weaver to work for one day. Therefore, there was some idea of increasing the pace of spinning. As a result of that enthusiasm, a person called James Hargreaves produced a machine called ‘Jenny’ in 1764 for cotton weaving. T his machine was a manually operated one. Later in 1769, Richard Arkwright produced a more efficient, water powered spinning wheel. It was named as ‘water turbine’. Arkwright’s creation was an important production when compared to the other machines used for the same purpose in the past. But it was difficult to be used in houses because it was very big in size. On the other hand, because a fast tide of water was needed to run the machine, it could be used only in such places where there was a continuous supply of water. Samuel Crompton who used the functioning principles of Spinning Jenny and the Water Turbine produced a new machine called “Mule” around 1779. This helped to produce finer and stronger threads. Then around 1785, Edmund Cartwright found a way of running the ‘Mule’ by steam power. Thus, within a period of about 30 years new machines and novel technical methods were invented to make spinning cotton more efficient. Hence, there was a big revolution in the weaving industry during a short period of time. ?Iron and Steel Industry Ore deposits are found in abundance in Britain. British people produced iron and steel even before the industrial revolution to make weapons, agricultural equipment and household tools. They used firewood to smelt ore for this purpose. It was difficult to meet the huge demand for iron and steel needed for the production of machinery that emerged as a result of the industrial revolution using firewood. Hence, alternative methods had to be looked for. In 1730 the method of smelting ore using coal was found by Abraham Darby. They produced molded iron in this method. In 1784 tempered iron could be produced with the invention of 'Roller' machine by Henri Cort. Henri Bessemer found a new method to produce steel by removing dirt from iron in 1856. The invention of open oven method in 1860, by developing the above mentioned method, enabled the production of high quality steel. Steel could be produced cheaply and quickly in this method. Making an electric oven to smelt ore by Wilhelm Siemens in 1870 helped the improvement of iron and steel industry. These mew creations paved the way for a rapid improvement in iron and steel industry. ?Coal Industry T here are so many coal mines in Britain. South Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire are some places where coal mines are situated. Coal was popular as a cheap and efficient fuel for smelting ore, running machines and household chores. Though the demand for coal increased with the industrial development, mining coal was difficult. Several new inventions were made in order to find solutions to the problems such as removing the water that gathered in the mine when it was dug deep, poisonous gases found in the depth, increasing heat and providing light to the depth. T homas Newcomen invented a steam engine in 1735 to pump water of the mines and artificially cool the air. Yet, it was inefficient and could not be used in other industries too. Therefore, James Watt developed this to a new steam engine in 1736. It was an efficient engine that could be used in many industries. T he problem of providing light to the mines too was solved when Humphry Davy produced the safety lamp in 1812. In 1839, a method was found to take coal out of the mines using iron cables instead of the old method of taking them out by women and children using copper cables. T he development of the coal industry resulted in several by products. Tar obtained by burning coal was used in road construction. Paints that were necessary in dyeing clothes too were made with the help of coal. It was further used to produce medicine, perfumes, oil and fertilizers.","Industrial Revolution in Britain centered on 3 industries: 1. Textile: Flying shuttle (John Kay 1733) sped weaving; Spinning Jenny (James Hargreaves 1764) for threads; Water frame (Richard Arkwright 1769) water-powered; Mule (Samuel Crompton 1779) finer threads; Steam power (Edmund Cartwright 1785). 2. Iron/Steel: Coal smelting (Abraham Darby 1730) for cast iron; Puddling/rolling (Henry Cort 1784) wrought iron; Bessemer process (Henry Bessemer 1856) cheap steel; Open-hearth (1860) high-quality steel; Electric arc furnace (William Siemens 1870). 3. Coal: Steam engine (Thomas Newcomen 1712, James Watt 1769 improved) for pumping/mining; Safety lamp (Humphry Davy 1815) for gas; Cable haulage (1839) replaced child labor. By-products: Tar (roads), dyes, chemicals. These fueled transport (railways), agriculture, communication.","In Britain’s misty mills, revolution roared—threads flew faster with Kay’s shuttle (1733), Hargreaves’ Jenny spun 8x more (1764), Arkwright’s water frame powered by rivers (1769), Crompton’s Mule wove dreams (1779), Cartwright harnessed steam (1785). Iron glowed—Darby’s coke smelted ore clean (1730), Cort’s rollers forged tough bars (1784), Bessemer blew steel cheap (1856), Siemens sparked electric furnaces (1870). Coal hearts beat—Newcomen/Watt’s engines pumped depths (1712/1769), Davy’s lamp lit safe (1815), cables hauled black gold (1839). Factories thrummed, rails snaked, ships steamed—textile clothed empires, iron built machines, coal fueled it all.

1.Industrial Revolution,Grade 11: Effects on Sri Lanka,"How the industrial revolution that started in Britain spread throughout the world within a short time has been explained above. Although the industrialization that took place in Britain and other European countries did not take place in Sri Lanka in the 19th century, the effects of the industrial revolution could be identified from Sri Lanka too. The major reason for that is, Sri Lanka being a colony of Britain when industrial revolution started. British people came to Sri Lanka and started mega scale cultivations. Many factories were started in connection to thus started cultivations such as tea, coconut, rubber and machines were imported from Britain to be used in those factories. Important incidents of this period: • Starting of a mill to pound coffee by the governor, Fredric North in 1804 AD • Using machines for activities of tea factories such as drying, grading and exporting • Using machines to prepare rubber for exporting • Introduction of Macadam method to build roads in 1885 T here was a need for manpower for the estates and factories and the labour class was formed by the people who worked there for salary. Landowners and factory owners became the affluent class and they organized themselves separately as a wealthy, educated middle class. The capitalist economic system grew in Sri Lanka and import and export trade held a prominent place. The necessity of a banking system was felt in order to handle financial transactions between countries in import and export. So, banks were started in Sri Lanka. T he transport system had to be developed in order to carry the estate products to trade centres and the harbour in Colombo and supply necessities to estates. Up to this time transportation was done by means of carts. Because it was not so efficient, roads and railways were introduced. The Colombo - Kandy road was constructed during the time of the governor, Edward Barns. Thereafter, roads to Kandy were built from Kurunegala and Dambulla. After that, the system of constructing roads using stones and tar was started. Further, the wood bridges that existed over water ways were replaced by iron bridges. The governor, Henry Ward started laying railways. T he construction of the Kandy railway was started in 1858 and was completed in 1863. In August 1867, a train service was started from Colombo to Kandy for the f irst time. After that it was extended from Peradeniya to Nawalapitiya in 1871 and up to Bandarawela in 1899. With the development of roads and transportation, trade centres were started and they expanded to cities. Gampola, Badulla, Ratnapura and Matale are such cities beyond Colombo that were populated during this time. Sending messages was done through a messenger up to this time. An official postal system had been started by 1815 connecting the cities like Colombo, Trincomalee, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna. T his was carried out using chariots. Thus, running chariots was started for the first time in Asia, in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka’s first postal stamp was issued in 1857. By 1903, 340 post offices had been opened around the country. The telegram service was started in 1858.","Though no factories like Britain, Industrial Revolution impacted colonial Sri Lanka: British planted mega estates (coffee 1804 mill Governor North, tea/rubber/coconut); imported machines for processing/export. Created wage labor class + wealthy/educated middle class (planters); capitalist import-export economy; banks for trade. Transport: Macadam roads (1885), iron bridges, railways (Colombo-Kandy 1867, extended Bandarawela 1899) for estate products. New cities grew (Gampola/Badulla/Ratnapura/Matale). Communication: Postal system (1815 chariot post, first Asian; stamp 1857, 340 offices 1903); telegram (1858).","Britain’s mighty engines never roared in Sri Lanka’s soil, yet their echoes reshaped the island under colonial rule. Governors planted vast estates—coffee mills humming (1804 North), tea leaves whirling through imported dryers, rubber sheets pressed by steam. Machines from foggy England turned green hills into gold for empire, birthing wage workers toiling rows and a polished middle class of planters. Capitalism took root—exports flooded Colombo harbor, banks rose for distant deals. Macadam roads snaked hills (1885), iron bridges spanned rivers, rails sang from Colombo to misty Kandy (1867), pushing deeper to Bandarawela (1899). Towns swelled—Gampola, Badulla, Ratnapura, Matale—pulses of new trade. Chariots dashed post (1815, Asia’s first), stamps flew (1857), telegrams clicked (1858). From quiet villages to connected colony, Britain’s revolution remade Ceylon—prosperity for few, transformation for all.",transformative,"steam_train_whistle, tea_processing_machine, horse_carriage, telegraph_beep, gentle_wind, chime"
