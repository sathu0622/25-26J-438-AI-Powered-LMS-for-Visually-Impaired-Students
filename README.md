# 📘 AI-Powered Document Processing & Summarization Backend

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **AI-powered backend system** for extracting and summarizing historical content from **Books, Magazines, and Newspapers**.  
The system is specially designed to support **visually impaired students** by generating **clear, structured, and voice-friendly summaries**.

The backend automatically:
- Extracts text using OCR
- Detects the resource type
- Applies context-aware summarization using a **LoRA fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model**

---



## 🎯 Key Features

- 📄 Supports **PDF and Image documents**
- 🔍 OCR-based text extraction (without grammar correction)
- 🧠 Automatic resource type detection (Book / Magazine / Newspaper)
- 📰 Article splitting for newspapers
- ✍️ Context-aware summarization
- 🚀 FastAPI backend
- 💾 Lightweight LoRA model (~25–100MB)

## 🧪 OCR Module

- Uses **Tesseract OCR**
- Supports scanned images and PDFs
- Converts PDFs to images before OCR
- No grammar correction (intentional design)
- Preserves raw extracted content

---

## ✍️ Summarization Strategy

Summarization behavior depends on the detected resource type:

| Resource Type | Summary Style |
|--------------|--------------|
| Newspaper | Short and factual |
| Magazine | Medium-length descriptive |
| Book | Long and detailed |
